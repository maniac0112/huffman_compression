# huffman_compression
A simple python program that compresses a string using Huffman's coding.
We denote every unique character in a string, a unique code.
This code for each character, should not be a prefix of code of any other character. 
This is to ensure a unique compression and decompression.
We assign shorter codes to more frequent letter, thereby making the compression more efficient.
